### About Me

My name is Aleksei Eaves, I am a programmer from Melbourne, Australia. I am currently in my first year of my Bachelors of Computer Science at RMIT University.

Currently my interest at the moment is mostly in low-level software — particularly operating systems — and networking.
I mostly program in C, though I'm also familiar with C++, Bash, and Java.

### Current Project

My current project is [apple-c](https://github.com/alekseiplusplus/apple-c), an emulator of the Apple I computer written in C. It is a work in progress; I currently have most of the CPU worked out. It has been on hiatus as I have had to focus on university, but I am eager to return to it.
