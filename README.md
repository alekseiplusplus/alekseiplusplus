### About Me

My name is Aleksei Eaves, I am a programmer from Melbourne, Australia. As of 2024, I am in my second year at RMIT University studying a Bach. of Engineering (Computer and Network Engineering) (Honours) / Bach. of Computer Science.

I mostly write programs in C / C++, and assembly languages. I am also familiar with Bash, PHP, and Common Lisp.

The domains which I am interested in are networking protocols and architecture, embedded systems, and operating systems.

### Current Projects

My primary project at the moment is lisp-x86-64. It is a challenge I have given to myself after learning x86 to write an interpreter for a Lisp-like language, as a way to solidify my learning through an intermediate project. It is unlikely you will find it useful even when it is finished.

My secondary project on Github is apple-c, which I am making slow progress on. I wanted to build a cross-platform emulator of the Apple I computer, which along with various provided documentation, can serve as an educational resource for anybody interested in retro personal computers.
